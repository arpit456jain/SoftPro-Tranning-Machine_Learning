It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms that to classify data or predict outcomes accurately

Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output.This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time
Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression:
